# Weatherstation GUI
The repository contains a QtQuick project that views any Panomax Webcam in a 360 degrees viewer and displays the current weather data as an overlay. The GUI follows the guidelines of Google Material 3 Design and uses dynamic color schemes.

The color scheme of the application automatically adapts to the current webcam image
